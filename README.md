## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to **Auto Clicker in Assembly**, a lightweight and super fast auto clicker built entirely in Assembly language! This project is designed for those who appreciate low-level programming and want to explore the power of Assembly while automating repetitive mouse-clicking tasks.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Runs smoothly on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **User Configurable**: Define the duration, click rate (per minute or per second), and whether to run indefinitely.
- **Lightweight**: Written in Assembly, offering minimal overhead and maximum performance.
- **Open Source**: Released under the MIT License, so you can freely use, modify, and distribute the code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Requirements

To get started, you'll need the following tools installed:

- **NASM**: The Netwide Assembler, for compiling Assembly code.
- **LD**: A linker for creating executables.
- **xdotool** (for Linux/macOS): A command-line tool for simulating keyboard and mouse input.

### Compilation Instructions

#### Windows

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto-clicker-assembly.git
    cd auto-clicker-assembly
    ```

2. **Compile and link**:
    ```bash
    nasm -f win32 src/autoclick.asm -o autoclick.obj
    ld autoclick.obj -o autoclick.exe -luser32 -lkernel32
    ```

3. **Run the program**:
    ```bash
    autoclick.exe
    ```

#### Linux/macOS

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto-clicker-assembly.git
    cd auto-clicker-assembly
    ```

2. **Install xdotool** (if not already installed):
    - Linux:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install xdotool
        ```
    - macOS:
        ```bash
        brew install xdotool
        ```

3. **Compile and link**:
    ```bash
    nasm -f elf32 src/autoclick.asm -o autoclick.o
    ld -m elf_i386 autoclick.o -o autoclick
    ```

4. **Run the program**:
    ```bash
    ./autoclick
    ```

## üéÆ Usage

Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter the following parameters:

1. **Duration**: Enter the number of seconds you want the auto clicker to run. Enter `0` to run indefinitely.
2. **Clicks Per Minute**: Specify how many clicks per minute you want. For example, enter `60` for 1 click per second.

### Example Scenarios

- **Run for 10 seconds with 60 clicks per minute**:
    - Duration: `10`
    - Clicks Per Minute: `60`

- **Run indefinitely with 120 clicks per minute (2 clicks per second)**:
    - Duration: `0`
    - Clicks Per Minute: `120`

## üß© Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether it's fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated.

### Contribution Guidelines

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Create a new branch**:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-name
    ```
3. **Make your changes** and **commit** them using Conventional Commits:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: add new click rate option"
    ```
    **Why Conventional Commits?**  
    Conventional Commits are important because they provide a consistent way of writing commit messages. This consistency helps in generating changelogs, automating versioning, and maintaining a clean project history. Following this convention is necessary for your contributions to be approved and merged.

    Some examples of Conventional Commits:
    - `feat: add option for infinite clicking`
    - `fix: correct calculation of click interval`
    - `docs: update README with new usage instructions`
4. **Push to your branch**:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature-name
    ```
5. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub.

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues or bugs, please [open an issue](https://github.com/yourusername/auto-clicker-assembly/issues) on GitHub. Be sure to include details such as your operating system, the steps to reproduce the issue, and any error messages.
